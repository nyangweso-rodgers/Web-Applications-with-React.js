# Introduction to `ReactJS`
* `React` is a `JavaScript library` used to build _User Interfaces_. 
* It is developed and maintained by __Facebook__. It is capable of building complex and highly interactive single-page web applications and can be integrated with any backend.

# How does React Work?
* __React__ creates a __VIRTUAL DOM__ in memory. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, __React__ creates a __virtual DOM__ in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

* __React__ only changes what needs to be changed! __React__ finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.

# Advantages of `ReactJS`
* Very fast, gives smooth experience to users
* Easy to develop and maintain due to its __Components__ based structure. A __component__ basically represent a piece of UI. Once a __component__ is created, it can be used as many times as you wish to.
* can be use on client-side and server-side devices
* reusable components rduce development time and help build complex functionalities
* data is updated by refreshing UI, making it efficient

# Cons OF `ReactJS`
* React uses traditional `MVC` framework and hence requires complex configuration.
* An in depth knowledge is required for integration the UI into `MVC framework`
* __Redux__ and Routing are external tools that need to be learnt, whereas Angular has most of these tools inbuilt.

# Popular Apps using `ReactJS`
* PayPal
* BBC
* Facebook
* Netflix
* Twitter

# ReactJS Concepts

# Concept 1: Virtual DOM
* __Virtual DOM__: uses a strategy that updates the `DOM` without having to redraw all the webpage elements. Every time the `DOM` changes, browsers need to recalculate entire layout and then repaint the web page which makes the web app slow. To overcome this, we have __virtual DOM__. Evrey time the state of our application changes, the __virtual DOM__ gets updates instead of the real `DOM`.

* Whenever the new element is added to the UI, a new __virtual DOM__ associated with that element is created. If state of this element chnages, a second new __virtual DOM__ is created which will be compared with the previous __virtual DOM__. It then updates ONLY the object on the real `DOM`.

# Concept 2: JavaScrip XML (JSX)
* `JSX`: an extension of `JavaScript` which allow us to write `HTML` code in `JavaScript` file. E.g., consider the below variable declaration. It's neither `JS` nor `HTML`. This is the mixture of `JavaScript` + `XML` = `JSX`. It is not necessary to work with `JSX`, but is recommended as it makes the code easier to understand.


    ```js
        cons element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    ```
* Why use `JSX`?
  * As it basically helps us write `HTML` tags inside `JS`, which ultimately makes __React__ faster.
  * JSX makes the code easier to understand and visually attractive.

    ```js
        class Hey extends React.Component {
            render(){
                return <div> Hello {this.props.iDontKnow}</div>;
            }
        }
        ReactDOM.render{
            <Hey iDontKnow="World"/>,
            document.getElementById('root')
        };
    ```

# Concept 3: React Components
* `components` - simple function that you can call with some input and they render some output.
* `components` are of two types:
  * __Class Based Component__: are defined using `ES6` classes.
  * __Function Based Component__: are basic `JavaScript` functions. A _Typical Function Component in React_ is as below:

    ```js
        import React from "react" // way of telling Babel that we are working with JSX filed so that it will not throw error while transforming code into the React.createElement calls
        
        '''
        Below id a React function component:
        This is quite similar to typical JavaScript functions. The only difference is, here we are returning HTML code because this is JSX(JavaScript XML)
        '''
        function componentName() {
            return {
                <h1>I am a function component</h1>
            }

        export default componentName; // Exporting the function (component) so that we can use it outside
    ```
