# 9 Building Blocks of a Web Application
* There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:
    1. __UI__: how users will consume and interact with your application.
    2. __Routing__ - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
    3. __Data Fetching__ - where your data lives and how to get it.
    4. __Rendering__ - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
    5. __Integrations__ - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
    6. __Infrastructure__ - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
    7. __Performance__ - how to optimize your application for end-users.
    8. __Scalability__ - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
    9. __Developer Experience__ - your team’s experience building and maintaining your application.
