# React.js Hooks

- Hooks let you manage **state** and other **React** feature without writing the **class component**. It was first introduced in `React 16.8`

1. **React Hooks** only work with the functional component.
2. You cannot call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
3. React hooks are backward compatible. i.e., if you have a React application that uses React version older than 16.8, you can update to a newer version of React that supports hooks without breaking your existing code.
