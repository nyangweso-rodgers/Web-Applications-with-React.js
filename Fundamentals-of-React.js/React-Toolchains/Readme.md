# `ReactJS` Toolchains


# Why Tooling is Needed
1. Act as a starting point for `React` applications
2. Transform `JSX` to `JavaScript`
3. Process `JavaScript` files
4. Run development server
5. Automatically update the browser when source files change
6. Create a production build


# Popular Toolchains for `React.js`
1. `create-react-app` (`CRA`)
2. `NextJS`
3. `Vite`

# `Vite` vs. `CRA`
* Choose `CRA` if you prioritize simplicity, ease of use and no-configuration setup.
* Choose `Vite` if you value speed, performance and flexibility.
